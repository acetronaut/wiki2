# What are Oracles?

In computer science oracles are considered to be special machines, that can provide answers to non-computable problems. In terms of that definition, all modern computers are **not** oracles. This fact is true, because all problems that computers solve basically come down to performing some sort of computation, based on certain finite input parameters. 

Therefore, oracles, or oracle machines, by definition <sup>1</sup>, can compute the uncomputible. In plain words, oracles can provide answers to the questions that are not mathematical problems. In terms of the terminology and the main point of refererence to Alan Turing's Theory of Computation, the internal workings of an oracle are unknown, but the oracle will always provide one and the same output as a response to one and the same input.
