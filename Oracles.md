# What are Oracles?

In computer science oracles are considered to be special machines, that can provide answers to non-computable problems. In terms of that definition, all modern computers are **not** oracles. This fact is true, because all problems that computers solve basically come down to performing some sort of computation, based on certain finite input parameters. 

Therefore, oracles, or oracle machines, by definition <sup>1</sup>, can compute the uncomputible. In plain words, oracles can provide answers to the questions that are not mathematical problems. In terms of the terminology and the main point of refererence to Alan Turing's Theory of Computation, the internal workings of an oracle are unknown, but the oracle will always provide one and the same output as a response to one and the same input. 

# Aeternity Oracles

## How do Aeternity oracles function?
Much like Turing's original oracle machine, an Aeternity oracle produces an ouput result, however, only to a given question. So, by itself an individual Aeternity oracle is not universal, but numerous oracles can be created, so that a multitude of questions can be answered. The oracle's output result is provided by the person, who has launched the oracle This person who has committed, by means of the Aeternity token, to provide an answer during a certain time frame, specified at the launch of the oracle. 

Because at this point in time, there are no hardware oracles, Aeternity oracles aim to provide a trustworthy YES or NO answer to every possible type of question, whose YES or NO answer can be substnatiated with real-world data. So again, the human brain will be part of performing a check to question's answer. That is natural because the human brain is an instantion of the oracle machine. Every single oracle resides on Aeternity's blockchain.
