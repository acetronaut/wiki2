If not, eventually the message will be removed once the article is finished, either by other contributors or myself. I hope the structure here will put lots of context for the new kids on the blockchain "block". Also, I by no means **will ever claim** this article is exhaustive enough of the topic/s discussed.

# Functions Of Money

First thing's first: let us see what money is and then we will put this information in some crypto-context.
So money is:
1. **A medium of exchange**
Unlike ancient times, wherer barter was in fashion, money serves as a medium of exchange. Essentially letting you convert something into something else - by buying and selling and receiving or spending money.
2. **A store of value**
Any asset that you can buy and/or save your money by investing in it - that is a store of value. It can be precious metals, stocks, real estate, jewelry, etc. Note that modern money (currency) are not a good store of value because if inflation. 
3. **A unit of account**
This function of money lets you compare the cost or value of different things in life - the price of this house vs. the price of the other one, for example. In most daily situations and economies, the medium of exchange is the same as the unit of account - i.e. one and the same currency. 

These three points characterize money. The intresting thing is that you can have an entity, able to execute all three functions, without it actualyl being money or an actual currency. That entity is cryptocurrency and bitcoin in particular.

## What/who determines cryptocurrencies prices:

The prices of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are greatly influenced by demand and supply. When the demand increases, the price will tend to rise or vice versa. But unlike other markets, cryptocurrency markets have a higher level of volatility as the prices fluctuates frequently.

While demand and supply may seem as the only factors that determines the prices of cryptocurrencies, there are other factors which attributes to the price as well. Speculation is one of those factors. It is fueled by recent press releases, development updates and reputational issues. More often than not, positive news and press releases tend to bring about rise in prices and vice versa. 

Other factors includes the introduction of digital assets in  larger exchange markets with high trading volume, acceptance of digital currencies by more merchants.

*PS: Digital assets are otherwise known as cryptocurrencies.*
