æternity Scripting Language
===========================


It is built for blockchain smart contracts.

This is a language make for state channels.

It is deterministic, so that every node of the blockchain gets the same result.

Functions are tail call optimized.

Has 2 types of gas, one for space, and one for time.

Instead of using goto for recursion, it uses function calls.

[Example code is in this folder](https://github.com/aeternity/chalang/blob/master/examples) , hashlock has lots of documentation.

to install:

sh install.sh

to start a node with these libraries loaded:

sh start.sh

to run tests on a node:

1> test_chalang:test().
