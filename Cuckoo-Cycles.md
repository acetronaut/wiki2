# Introduction of Proof of Work 
A proof of work(PoW) system allows for the checker to verify with minimal effort that a proper has expended a large amount of computational effort. Originally used for fighting spam, where a sender has to expend a large amount of effort to demand the attention of a recipient, now it is a cornerstone of crypto-currencies. 
For example, Bitcoin uses Hashcash. Hashcash entails finding a nonce value such that application of a cryptographic hash function to this nonce and the rest of the block header, results in a number below a target threshold. The threshold is dynamically adjusted by the protocol so as to maintain an average block interval of 10 minutes.
Bitcoinâ€™s choice of the simple and purely compute-bound SHA256 hash function allowed for an easy migration of hash computation from desktop processors (CPUs) to graphics-card processors (GPUs), to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and finally to custom designed chips (ASICs), with huge improvements in energy-efficiency at every step.
However, there is a current problem with Hashcash, that individuals or organizations can decide to invest heavily into mining bitcoin by buying or fabricating ASICs that have high energy efficiency and superior hash computation speed, thereby making up most of the hash power. Since Bitcoin is based on POW, these individuals would be able to attack the network as they are able to double spend their Bitcoins by creating blocks faster than the rest of the network. 
# Motivation 
Cuckoo Cycle aims to minimize performance-per-dollar differences on different hardware architectures and make mining on commodity hardware more cost effective. This is to be achieved by making main memory latency a bottleneck, since DRAM latencies have remained relatively stable while cpu-speed and memory bandwidth vary highly across hardware architecture and process technology.
Our aim of a memory bound PoW translates to the following desirable properties:
1. A target memory footprint that exceeds a single memory chip
2. A pattern of necessarily random memory accesses 
3. Minimal computation per memory access 
4. No feasible trade off of memory for time 
A memory bound PoW aims to take advantage of the huge economies of scale of commodity DRAM
production to make DRAM chips the most cost-effective vehicle for mining. Just as SRAM is one order
of magnitude faster but two orders more expensive than DRAM, so it is conceivable that development
and production of custom memory chips for a memory bound PoW will incur a sufficient cost premium
to wipe out any performance gains.
