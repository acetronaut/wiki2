# Types of users, and where they might start

Anyone who wants to store or transfer value, with unparalleled speed, reliability and privacy will be able to use æternity to do so. Everything Bitcoin and Ethereum can do, just got upgraded. Below is a summary of the various user types and how they might start with Æternity.

* Contributors:

    Contributors can directly support Æternity by participating in the [second phase](https://wallet.aeternity.com/) of the contribution campaign or by purchasing AE tokens directly on an exchange once Aeon is listed in them. To do this, users must first be registered on an exchange where Aeon is trading. Next, the user must have funds available for which to purchase Aeon (likely ETH). Once the transaction is complete, the user can choose to store the AE tokens on the exchange (not recommended) or transfer to a wallet.

    In addition, many decentralised applications will be written on top of Æternity. Contributors will be able to participate in challenging and cutting-edge projects on the most cutting-edge blockchain by contributing to their initial coin offerings and/or purchasing their tokens on an exchange. 

* Speculators:

    The value of Aeon will be recognised by all forward thinking people. Although we don't endorse it, many people will 
want to speculate on the potential and price of Aeon. Anyone interested in speculating in Æternity will, again, need to be registered on an exchange where AE tokens can be purchased. Typically speculators purchase assets hoping to make short term profits based on anticipated developments in the fundamentals or the emergence of certain profitable trading patterns.
 
* Contract writers & Developers:

    Thanks to its unique features (State channels, Decentralised oracles, On-chain Governance, ENS) on top of everything 
other blockchains have to offer, æternity will be logical choice for all developers and Smart-Contracts writers. It will be the Backbone of the Internet-of-Things.

* Miners:

    Miners (Proof-of-Work) will be able to be rewarded for providing the adequate security to the æternity blockchain. The specificity of Cuckoo Cycle algorithm will enable anyone to become a miner, thus achieving great decentralisation. Oracles Mining (Proof-of-Stake) will be rewarded to provide real world data to the æternity Blockchain.
