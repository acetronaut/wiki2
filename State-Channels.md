State channels are a new development in blockchain technology. They come from the realization that for most purposes only the actors involved in a smart contract need to know about it. Two (or more) actors lock a state in the blockchain and then perform (signed) transactions between themselves, off-chain. The final state is then logged on the blockchain. If this end result is for some reason disputed, the series of signed off-chain transactions can be uploaded to the blockchain for verification and dispute resolution. 

The fact that State Channels are mostly off chain allows for both improved scalability, because most of the computation and storage of intermediate states is done off-chain, and improved privacy, since only the intervening parties know about the details of the transaction.
