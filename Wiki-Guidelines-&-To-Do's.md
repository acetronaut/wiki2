# Wiki Guidelines
The dedicated Wiki channel on Slack is [HERE](https://aeternity.slack.com/messages/C59BALQCE/details/) feel free to join us!

Before **adding** content:
* read wiki content, regarding your topic especially thoroughly, before adding any new content (duplicated content will not be counted as wiki bounty)

Markdown & Syntax:
* you can jump right in and edit if you see a mistake or something that looks weird (these are valid contributions to the wiki bounty)
* make sure you use relative links wherever possible! eg. if you want to refer to the "[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-Aeternity]]" page, you can use `[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-Aeternity]]`

**When editing anything, please always comment your changes in the edit message.**
