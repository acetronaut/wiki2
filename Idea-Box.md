### Google Calendar Plug In

It would be great to have a google calendar plug in, to have a comprehensive overview of meet ups and events.
There is a [plug in](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-google-spreadsheet-plugin/21673/2) available, but don't know if its working & another [MediaWiki plug in](https://www.mediawikiwidgets.org/Google_Calendar) but unsure if it's working with discourse.
