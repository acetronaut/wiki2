# Wiki Wishes
## Google Calendar Plug In

It would be great to have a google calendar plug in, to have a comprehensive overview of meetups and events.
There is a [MediaWiki plug in](https://www.mediawikiwidgets.org/Google_Calendar) available, but don't know if it's working.

## Subpages
In order to better structure the content in the wiki, subpages would be very useful.

# Use Case Ideas for æternity
## Supply Chain Management
High-level concept of Supply Chain Management (SCM) automation with Smart Contracts, Prediction Markets, and Oracles.

## Prediction Markets
> Prediction Markets (created with Oracles) are one of the most anticipated use cases for blockchains. They can make possible the harnessing of the wisdom of the crowds in a decentralized and transparent manner for the first time.

[What's and Oracle?](https://github.com/aeternity/testnet/wiki/Understanding-Aeternity#what-is-an-oracle)  

* Digital Insurance Marketplace - 'Bond of Trust' flattened into a simple product based on prediction market odds, tradable on the digital marketplace to provide instant insurance by the hour.

## Gaming
> [State channels](https://github.com/aeternity/testnet/wiki/Research-and-Theory#state-channels) can be used through special nodes to play games using æon (AE). Either single player games, between friends, or even total strangers. æternity will enable trust-less gaming applications, where no player puts his trust into the other's infrastructure or central servers, but into the state channels of the æternity Blockchain.

## Dominant Assurance Contracts
> Dominant Assurance Contract is a mechanism originally designed to provide public goods and funding public projects.
It's similar to a smart contract. Funds are collected and locked in Dominance Assurance Contract. Part of the funds are locked for development and other parts for ROI for investors.
Once a milestone is cleared and approved the contract will release funds allocated to that specific milestone.
If the milestone is not reached, investors get their investments and interests back. 

* Kickstarter 2.0 (with a Money Back guarantee & milestone dependent release of funds)

## Micro- & Nano Payments
> æternity will be the preferred Blockchain for the Micro and Nano payments. No other Blockchain now can match the speed that's provided by æternity's [state channels.](https://github.com/aeternity/testnet/wiki/Research-and-Theory#state-channels)

Once such example of this use case is the rollout of hundreds of charging stations for electric cars using  Ethereum in Germany. Innogy, a subsidiary of Germany’s energy giant RWE has added blockchain capabilities to their E2E Product using asset-backed Crypto-EURO for payments in charging stations for electric vehicles.

> Because the idea here is for, eventually, the car itself to pay the charging station. How? The exact details would probably be closely guarded, but at a high level you can blockchainize the car, give it a smart contract, connect it to wi-fi, and write some code which orders it to pay if:then, while:else etc.
