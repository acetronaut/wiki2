## Wiki Wishes
### Google Calendar Plug In

It would be great to have a google calendar plug in, to have a comprehensive overview of meet ups and events.
There is a [MediaWiki plug in](https://www.mediawikiwidgets.org/Google_Calendar) available, but don't know if its working.

### Subpages
In order to better structure the content in the wiki, sub pages would be very useful.

## Use Case Ideas for æternity
### Prediction Markets

Prediction markets (Oracles) are one of the most anticipated use cases for blockchains. They can make possible the harnessing of the wisdom of the crowds in a decentralised and transparent manner for the first time.
Ethereum has Augur and Gnosis trying to build prediction markets on top of it, with each its different system and currency.
æternity differentiates itself, by having the Oracle's layer integrated into the blockchain, using the Aeons as betting to be able to bring real world information to the blockchain, and use it in the execution of smart contracts.

### Gaming

State channels can be used through special nodes to play games using æon (AE). Either single player games, between friends, or even total strangers. æternity will enable trust-less gaming applications, where no player puts his trust into the other's infrastructure or central servers, but into the state channels of the æternity Blockchain.

### Dominant Assurance Contracts

### Micro- & Nano Payments

æternity will be the preferred Blockchain for the Micro and Nano payments. No other Blockchain now can match the speed that's provided by æternity's state channels.
The state channels enable a huge amount of throughput of transaction between partners, while keeping all unnecessary info off-chain, which will result in more privacy, and less Blockchain bloating.
