### Google Calendar Plug In

It would be great to have a google calendar plug in, to have a comprehensive overview of meet ups and events.
There is a [plug in](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-google-spreadsheet-plugin/21673/2) available, but don't know if its working & another [MediaWiki plug in](https://www.mediawikiwidgets.org/Google_Calendar) but unsure if it's working with discourse.


## Use Case Ideas for æternity
### Prediction Markets

Prediction markets (Oracles) are one of the most anticipated use cases for blockchains. They can make possible the harnessing of the wisdom of the crowds in a decentralised and transparent manner for the first time.
Ethereum has Augur and Gnosis trying to build prediction markets on top of it, with each its different system and currency.
æternity differentiates itself, by having the Oracle's layer integrated into the blockchain, using the Aeons as betting to be able to bring real world information to the blockchain, and use it in the execution of smart contracts.
