## Wiki Wishes
### Google Calendar Plug In

It would be great to have a google calendar plug in, to have a comprehensive overview of meet ups and events.
There is a [MediaWiki plug in](https://www.mediawikiwidgets.org/Google_Calendar) available, but don't know if its working.

### Subpages
In order to better structure the content in the wiki, sub pages would be very useful.

## Use Case Ideas for æternity
### Prediction Markets

Prediction markets (Oracles) are one of the most anticipated use cases for blockchains. They can make possible the harnessing of the wisdom of the crowds in a decentralised and transparent manner for the first time.

Ethereum has Augur and Gnosis trying to build prediction markets on top of it, with each its different system and currency.
æternity differentiates itself, by integrating the Oracle into the blockchain consensus. 

Any user may create an Oracle by posing a question or statement, staking coins and providing a binary or a scaled answering option. 
AE coins can be used to acquire stakes of those specific outcomes. 
The more sure a user is about the outcome, the more stakes he may acquire and hence the more likely (he thinks) it's, that the outcome will be correct. Applying the wisdom of the crowd to all participating users of the prediction market, it is possible to 

a) statistically predict the probability of a future event occuring  

b) verify historic data from legacy systems or other blockchains

c)  verify API data from legacy systems or other blockchains

Meaning any data outside the blockchain can be translated into a deterministic value that can be used in æternity smart contracts, making real-world data easy accessible and actionable.

### Gaming

State channels can be used through special nodes to play games using æon (AE). Either single player games, between friends, or even total strangers. æternity will enable trust-less gaming applications, where no player puts his trust into the other's infrastructure or central servers, but into the state channels of the æternity Blockchain.

### Dominant Assurance Contracts

### Micro- & Nano Payments

æternity will be the preferred Blockchain for the Micro and Nano payments. No other Blockchain now can match the speed that's provided by æternity's state channels.

The state channels enable a huge amount of throughput of transaction between partners, while keeping all unnecessary info off-chain, which will result in more privacy, and less Blockchain bloating.
