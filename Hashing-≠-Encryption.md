# The differences between hashing and encryption

In this article we have set to explain the major difference between hashing and encryption and how each process is important to blockchain architecture and crypto tokens. 

## Hashing
By definition, hashing means taking an arbitrary piece of data and mapping it to data of fixed size. In reality, this means that if you hash the word "hello" and a whole page of text, the two hashes will always have one and the same length, when processed through the same hashing function. 

The output of the hashing function is the hash. There are two major facts about hashing that every person, taking intereste in blockchain technology should know:
* hashing one and the same input will **always** produce one and the same hash output;
* given an output hash, one **can not** "unhash" it, or see the input;
* every ouput hash can be **instantaneously checked** if it is the result of a specific input that has been hashed.



The output of the hashing functions
 One-way hashing function
Easy to check if true BUT impossible to recreate the input data
Hashing â‰  encrypting 
Encryption supposes someone will decrypt something, with hashing you can only check values

**Important:** the expression "two-way hashing function" is an oxymoron.
