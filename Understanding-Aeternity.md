# What is Æternity?

Æternity is a new type of blockchain that innovates and expands upon existing platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Augur. Æternity will use secure smart contracts that interface with real-world data through decentralized oracles. Æternity differs from Ethereum by using trustless Turing-complete state channels to achieve scalability.

Æternity is unique in many ways, but the key features are:

- Hybrid PoW;
- Oracle Machine;
- State Channels, or "Off-chain transactions" will allow for both increased transaction time as well as improving anonymity when sending and receiving transactions;
- Governance;
- Address naming system;

# What is blockchain?

A secure ledger distributed among volunteer's computers governed only by the Æternity software. 

# What is special about Æternity and how does it compare to other blockchains?
(Focus on Oracles, practicality, flexibility, the AE court, state channels)

While other smart contract platforms can have oracle machines implemented on top of them, Æternity is unique in that it contains oracles as a smart contract "primitive." Having mechanisms that allow for real-world truth to enter into the chain state, in a reliable way, offers the possibility of smart contract creation with substantial real-world use cases. 
 
# What is an Oracle?

An oracle is a mechanism to teach the blockchain true facts about our world. This is a virtual machine that crowdsources real-time answers to specific questions using principles of prediction markets and can also be used to negotiate fundamental changes on how the system functions, allowing for high adaptability to market demands and other developments. Good examples include weather conditions, currency valuation and any other information, accessible to the public.

# What are State Channels?
The State Channel design enables off chain verification of data and smart contracts, only if the verification in the channel fails is the block chain is asked to resolve. This in return permits a high transactional throughput and parallel processing of smart contracts. Hence the programability of complex relationships for large numbers of users, as well as handling high volumes of products and information in parallel, is aeternity's strong suit.
Only the parties participating in a smart contract know about the contents of that smart contract.
When a channel is settled on-chain, the only way it changes the blockchain state is by changing account balances.
No contract state is stored on-chain, so all channels are independent from each other. Transaction speed is limited only by bandwidth, so the aeternity system can scale as well as known centralized solutions available today.

# How does Æternity work?
(Highlevel, also describe the proof system, state channels):

# What are AE Tokens and how are they used and consumed?

The Æternity tokens will be used to pay for resources consumed through the platform, as well as "gas" used to power applications built on top of it.

All Æternity tokens will be distributed via the genesis block through an ERC20 Ethereum Smart contract, and at a later stage by mining.

# How can Æternity be used?

Toll API: Payment channels allow for a new kind of API, where one
pays for every call to the API, possibly every HTTP-request.
Paying to access an API solves DDoS problems, and it makes
it easier to build high-quality APIs that are always available.

Stable value assets : We
can use the combination smart contracts and oracles to program synthetic assets that stay
nearly the same price as a real world asset.

Event contracts: Event contracts pay when an event
happens and don’t pay when an event does not happen, as
per the oracle’s telling. Event contracts can be used as the basis for many other types of useful applications such as encouraging whistle blowing and supporting prediction markets.

Micropayments: Aeternity's state channels will allow for off-chain, peer-to-peer payments will open up many revenue generation possibilities for content creators and publishers. While micropayments are currently possible other blockchains, tx/min and block size limitations prevent many current blockchains from being able to handle micropayments at scale.  

P2P Bandwidth Sales: State channel supported payments could allow for compensation-based sharing of wifi hotspots. Think of it like an Uber-for-wifi. Anyone could offer wifi to anyone else via their mobile phone for a price. 

Like any platform, the potential applications are limited only by the imagination of the user base. 

# Purchasing and acquiring Æternity: 

The first round available to purchase Æternity was during Æternity's public 'Friends, Family and Real Innovators' round which took place on 3rd April 2017, 13:05 GMT and lasted for 72 hours until 6th April 13:05 GMT. This round was open to the public, meaning anyone could participate. At this time, you were able to buy 1000 AE tokens for 1 ETH. Investors in the first 24 hours received an extra 10% for a total of 1100 AE tokens for 1 ETH. 

The second round will begin 21st May 2017. You can participate as well as follow any updates here: https://wallet.aeternity.com/
