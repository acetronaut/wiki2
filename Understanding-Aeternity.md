# What is Æternity?

Æternity is a new type of blockchain that innovates and expands upon existing platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Augur. Æternity will use secure smart contracts that interface with real-world data through decentralized oracles. Æternity differs from Ethereum by using trustless Turing-complete state channels to achieve scalability.

Æternity is unique in many ways, but the key features are:

- Hybrid PoW;
- Oracle Machine;
- State Channels, or "Off-chain transactions" will allow for both increased transaction time as well as improving anonymity when sending and receiving transactions;
- Governance;
- Address naming system;

# What is blockchain?

A secure ledger distributed among volunteer's computers governed only by the Æternity software. 

# What is special about Æternity and how does it compare to other blockchains?
(Focus on Oracles, practicality, flexibility, the AE court, state channels)

# What is an Oracle?

An oracle is a mechanism to teach the blockchain true facts about our world. This is a virtual machine that crowdsources real-time answers to specific questions using principles of prediction markets and can also be used to negotiate fundamental changes on how the system functions, allowing for high adaptability to market demands and other developments. Good examples include weather conditions, currency valuation and any other information, accessible to the public.

# What are State Channels?
The State Channel design enables off chain verification of data and smart contracts, only if the verification in the channel fails is the block chain is asked to resolve. This in return permits a high transactional throughput and parallel processing of smart contracts. Hence the programability of complex relationships for large numbers of users, as well as handling high volumes of products and information in parallel, is aeternity's strong suit.
Only the parties participating in a smart contract know about the contents of that smart contract.
When a channel is settled on-chain, the only way it changes the blockchain state is by changing account balances.
No contract state is stored on-chain, so all channels are independent from each other. Transaction speed is limited only by bandwidth, so the aeternity system can scale as well as known centralized solutions available today.

# How does Æternity work?
(Highlevel, also describe the proof system, state channels):

# What are AE Tokens and how are they used and consumed?

The Æternity tokens will be used to pay for resources consumed through the platform, as well as "gas" used to power applications built on top of it.

All Æternity tokens will be distributed via the genesis block through an ERC20 Ethereum Smart contract, and at a later stage by mining.

# Purchasing and acquiring Æternity: 

The first round available to purchase Æternity was during Æternity's public 'Friends, Family and Real Innovators' round which took place on 3rd April 2017, 13:05 GMT and lasted for 72 hours until 6th April 13:05 GMT. This round was open to the public, meaning anyone could participate. At this time, you were able to buy 1000 AE tokens for 1 ETH. Investors in the first 24 hours received an extra 10% for a total of 1100 AE tokens for 1 ETH. 

The second round will begin 21st May 2017. You can participate as well as follow any updates here: https://wallet.aeternity.com/
