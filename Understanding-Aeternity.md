To present a highly scalable blockchain architecture with a consensus mechanism which is also used to check the oracle. Aeternity's oracle will not be decentralized, but very efficient and cost-effective because it avoids layering one consensus mechanism on top of another.  To integrate state channels to increase privacy and scalability. Tokens in channels can be transferred using purely functional smart contracts that can access oracle answers. By not storing contract code or state on-chain, we are able to make smart contracts easier to analyze and faster to process, with no substantial loss in de facto functionality.
