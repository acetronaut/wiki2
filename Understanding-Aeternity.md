To presents a highly scalable blockchain architecture with a consensus mechanism which is also used to check the oracle. Thus the oracle will gets efficient, layering one consensus mechanism on top of another will be avoided. State channels integrated to increase the privacy and scalability. Tokens in channels can be transferred using purely functional smart contracts that can access oracle answers .By not storing contract code or state on-chain, we are able to make smart contracts easier to analyze and faster to process, with no substantial loss in de facto functionality
