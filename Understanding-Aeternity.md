# What is Æternity?

Æternity is a new type of blockchain that innovates and expands upon existing platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Augur. Æternity will use secure smart contracts that interface with real-world data through decentralized oracles. Æternity differs from Ethereum by using trustless Turing-complete state channels to achieve scalability.

Æternity is unique in many ways, but the key features being the following:

- Hybrid PoW
- Oracle Machine 
- State Channels, or "Off-chain transactions" will allow for both increased transaction time as well as improving anonymity when sending and receiving transactions
- Governance
- Address naming system

# What is blockchain?

A secure ledger distributed among volunteers computers governed by the æternity software only. 

# What is special about Æternity and how does it compare to other blockchains?
(Focus on Oracles, practicality, flexibility, the AE court, state channels)

# What is an Oracle?

An oracle is a mechanism to teach the blockchain true facts about our world.

# What is State Channels?
Only the parties participating in a smart contract know about the contents of that smart contract.
When a channel is settled on-chain, the only way it changes the blockchain state is by changing account balances.
No contract state is stored on-chain, so all channels are independent from each other. This means that channel transactions can be processed in parallel.

# How does Æternity work?
(Highlevel, also describe the proof system, state channels):

# What are AE Tokens and how are they used consumed?

The Æternity tokens will be used to pay for resources consumed through the platform, as well as "gas" used to power applications built on top of it.

All Æternity tokens will be distributed via the genesis block through an Ethereum Smart contract, and by mining.

# Purchasing and acquiring Æternity: 

The first round available to purchase Æternity was during Æternity's public 'Friends, Family and Real Innovators' round which took place on April 3rd, 13:05 GMT and lasted for 72 hours until April 6th 13:05 GMT. This round was open to the public, meaning anyone could participate. At this time, you were able to buy 1000 AE tokens for 1 ETH. Investors in the first 24 hours received an extra 10% for a total of 1100 AE tokens for 1 ETH. 

The second round will begin May 21st. You can participate as well as follow for any updates here: https://wallet.aeternity.com/
