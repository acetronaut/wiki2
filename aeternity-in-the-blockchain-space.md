The blockchain space is growing at an exponential rate each day and there are many players in the space, so how does aeternity compare?

# Bitcoin: 

First mover advantage in cryptocurrency giving it a huge head start but also a first mover disadvantage - it's old technology, no smart contracts, small blocks with slow 10 minute block times. 

aeternity is brand new technology on a lightning network with smart contracts, oracles & state channels.

# Ethereum: 

Ethereum also has a first mover advantage in the smart contract space and a huge amount of learnings were generated in the first years aeternity is taking these learnings and resolving these issues.

> On Ethereum Smart-contracts exist On-chain for multiple blocks. They hold state and can interact with other contracts. It only provides a ground layer for Smart-Contracts, with no coherent design, no coherent API for web apps, no naming system or Oracles. All these are being built on top of the Block-chain.

> On Ã¦ternity contracts only exists for a moment. They are settled independently of all the other contracts via state channels. This solution makes the blockchain use-cases and throughput more scalable for mainstream adoption and adequate to private use cases.

(Compare with dapps?) 

# Augur: 

Prediction market based on using the Ethereum decentralized network to create an accurate forecasting tool.. 

(Technology used, user base, comparisons) 


# Gnosis:

Futarchy / governance - how this compare. 

dApp on the Ethereum blockchain vs aeternity

Realitykeys external oracle provider intergration

(Comparisons on both to aeternity i.e. it will use its down blockchain)

# Cosmos:

Communication lines between different blockchains, could be used as a trustless exchange
