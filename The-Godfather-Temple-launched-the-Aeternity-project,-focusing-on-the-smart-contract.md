The "Godfather" is focused on the Smart Contract
Computer scientist Yanislav Malahov and venture capitalist Andreas Kohl have been working to reshape the foundation of today's smart contract.
For this purpose, they created a software company called Aeternity. According to Malahov, the company aims to improve the speed, reliability and scalability of block chains by leveraging smart contracts on side chains. In most existing systems, all calculations are made on the main chain.
"Our block chains allow people to use financial tools more, increase stability and increase speed," says Malahov. "Aeternity will also allow real-world information to flow into block chains without relying on mediating sources of information.
Liberal paradise
Malahov had a relationship with Michael Prince at the German tax conference, after which he set up Aeternity in Liechtenstein in November. Malahov said Michael prince was interested in block chain technology and suggested that he meet with venture capitalist Andreas Kohl.
Malahov learns from Liechtenstein's banking industry from local regulators and has decided to build Aeternity in Germany.
Andreas Kohl said that Liechtenstein was a liberal utopia that had some transparency and trust between entrepreneurs and the government, which could not be replaced by other places.
The idea of ​​the Godfather Temple
Over the past six years, Malahov has worked with leading innovators in encrypted currency and block chains, including Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin, co-founders of the Swiss etherways.
In a blog post in 2015, Malahov called himself the "godfather" of the tower. The blog post announces his dialogue with Buterin.
"I was already a member of the Ether Square before becoming famous," Malahov said.
Malahov has previously worked on the development of the Bitalias block chain system, as well as other projects with companies such as McConaghy.
Malahov was born in Bulgaria and was educated in Germany. He was aware of economic inequality and financial market turmoil in his early years.
"I have always thought that the current financial market is problematic, and the financial crisis we have experienced is that the block-chain technology is the next important step we need to take," he said.
Malahov argues that block-chain technology and its related applications can make the global economy more equitable and inclusive.
Malahov said that most people in the world do not have bank deposits, and block-chain technology may be one of the biggest opportunities for them to enter the modern financial system. 【Coin family block chain ICO project (http://www.wanbizu.com/ICO/)】
