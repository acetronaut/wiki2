GLOSSARY

# Blockchain 
A distributed, tamper-proof database with metered
access. The database is defined by a growing list of
hash-linked blocks and can have any rules for appending
them.

# Aeon 
An aeon represents a unit of account and an access
right to the Æternity blockchain. It is transferable.
Transaction A message from a user to the blockchain.
This is how users can use their currency to access the
blockchain.

# State Channel 
A relationship between two users recorded
on the blockchain. It enables users to send aeon back
and forth, and to create trustless smart contracts between
them that are enforced and settled by the blockchain.
Hash A hash takes as input a binary of any size. It gives
a fixed sized output. The same input always hashes to
the same output. Given an output, one cannot calculate
the input.

# Hashlocking 
This is how we connect pairs of channels to
make smart contracts that involve more than 2 people.
A secret is referenced by it’s hash. When the secret is
revealed, it can update multiple channels at the same
time.

# Governance 
A well-defined process of making decisions for
the future protocol(s) of the blockchain.

# Oracle 
A mechanism that tells the blockchain facts about
the world we live in. Using oracles users can predict the
outcome of events, external to the blockchain system.
Value-Holder A user who owns aeon, or a financial derivative
in the system.

# Validator 
A validator is a user who participates in the
consensus mechanism. In the case of Æternity, every
value-holder can participate.
