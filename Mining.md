# What is mining?

Volunteers can run the Aeternity mining software on computers, servers or mobile devices to order and validate transactions. Miners are compensated with the issuance of aeon tokens, the native cryptocurrency asset of the Aeternity network. Aeon can be used as payment for any resources one consumes on the Aeternity platform, as well as the basis for financial applications implemented on the platform.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other cryptocurrencies, Aeternity uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work ("POW") and Proof-of-Stake ("POS") consensus mechanism. The POW algorithm used is called the Cuckoo Cycle.

# How can you earn AE by securing the network and setting up a node

The Consensus on the aeternity blockchain is achieved via a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. The Proof-of-work will be done by miners via the "Cuckoo Cycle" algorithm. Proof-of-Stake is implemented via on-chain prediction markets, which project the information available to the network to one single number between 0 and 1. This number is used to signal to the miners which version of the blockchain to mine on.

# Which kind of hardware is best for Proof-of-Work mining?

The "Cuckoo Cycle" PoW is more power-efficient and indirectly useful, as it encourages the development of better random access memory (DRAM) chips. The best part is that even low power devices such as smartphones can efficiently mine new tokens, achieving an unparalleled decentralization, which is crucial to the success of any blockchain.

As such, Aeternity mining is designed to be more egalitarian and inclusive compared to cryptocurrencies where mining is dominated by large mining entities which use application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") chips designed specifically to take advantage of a particular POW algorithm.

As noted by John Tromp in his paper, "Cuckoo Cycle: a memory bound graph-theoretic proof-of-work":
>”[Cuckoo Cycle is] an instantly verifiable memory bound PoW that is unique in being dominated by latency rather than computation. In that sense, mining Cuckoo Cycle is a form of ASIC mining where DRAM chips serve the application of randomly reading and writing billions of bits. When even phones charging overnight can mine without orders of magnitude loss in efficiency, not with a mindset of profitability but of playing the lottery, the mining hardware landscape will see vast expansion, benefiting adoption as well as decentralization.”
