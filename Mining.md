# What is mining?

A bounty will be given to volunteers who run the aeternity mining software on computers, servers or mobile devices. The bounty will be given in form of AE, which is the digital coin of the aeternity network, which can then be kept do do things on aeternity or be sold on the market.

# How can you earn AE by securing the network and setting up a node

The Consensus on the aeternity blockchain is achieved via a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. The Proof-of-work will be done by miners via the "Cuckoo Cycle" algorithm. Proof-of-Stake is implemented via on-chain prediction markets, which project the information available to the network to one single number between 0 and 1. This number is used to signal to the miners which version of the blockchain to mine on.

# Which kind of hardware is best for Proof-of-Work mining?

The "Cuckoo Cycle" PoW is more power-efficient and indirectly useful, as it encourages the development of better random access memory (DRAM) chips. The best part is that even low power devices such as smartphones can efficiently mine new tokens, achieving an unparalleled decentralization, which is crucial to the success of any blockchain.
